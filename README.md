## Description
As professional developers, we created a Gitfit Website that consists of different workouts to provide a better life. We provided detailed information on workouts, how to get in contact with us, and how to sign up. Our motivation for creating this project was to help those that are motivated to get fit. The most important thing we learned was organization and staying on track with things is the key.
